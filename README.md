# NPD

The C++ implementation of NPD
Notice:The code is being Test!
I haven't train a model out with large size data.

# Difference with Matlab Code

- Neg Samples Mining in every Iter.
- Always training in LearGAB , don't jump out to TrainDector as Matlab Code.
- Can't retrain and without detect code at now.
